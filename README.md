# The Garrison v2.0


The Garrison is a custom built automated bartender based around a raspberry Pi 3. The origonal Garrison was our entry into Bristol Universities 2017 Hackathon, and since then the designs and software have evolved dramatically. As a group of students/tech geeks we wanted The Garrison to a cool and nerdy way of making drinks at parties. It takes input from a web page that the Pi hosts on the local network, and then uses a combination of actuators, pumps, and a stepper-motor controlled trolley to mix the perfect cocktail.

## Meet the Hardware
The physical constructon of the Garrison was primarrily made with 18mm MDF which provides a material that is both strong, and easy to machine. If you are thinking of making your own bartender, the CAD drawings and dimensions can be found [here](http://beepboop.tech).
